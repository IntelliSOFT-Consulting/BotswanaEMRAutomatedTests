## 1. Install Cypress
Follow [these](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) instructions to install Cypress. 
(This specific tests run on cypress version @9.5.0)

Run this command to install the specific version needed for this project.

`npm cypress install@9.5.0`



## 2. Fork this repo
You'll need to fork the project first.

After forking this project in Github, run these commands:

```
## clone this repo to a local directory
git clone https://github.com/IntelliSOFT-Consulting/BotswanaEMRAutomatedTests.git

## cd into the cloned repo
cd BotswanaEMRAutomatedTests

## install the node_modules
npm install

## start the local webserver
npx cypress open 
The npm cypress start script will spawn a new cypress tab which hosts the test scripts that can then be run on your browser.

```


## 3. Run the tests
The tests are located in the cypress/integration folder. The tests are grouped into folders based on the module they are testing. The tests are also grouped into files based on the functionality they are testing. The tests are also commented to explain what they are testing.

To run each test, access the cypress window that pops up when the ``` npx cypress open ``` command is typed and ran in the terminal.
Click on the test file and then click on the test you want to run. The test will then run on your browser.

```

NB: For each test, the site will be accessed and the user will be logged in. 
This is done to ensure that the tests are independent of each other. 
This means that the tests can be run in any order and they will still pass.

```

This test will login to the application and verify that the user is logged in.

Cypress IntelliSense
If you use modern IDE that supports TypeScript (like VSCode), you can benefit from Cypress type declarations included with the cypress NPM module. Just add @ts-check to the spec file and configure "dummy" tsconfig.json file and see IntelliSense over cy.<something> commands.

cy.type IntelliSense

Custom commands
This project also adds several custom commands in cypress/support/commands.js. They are useful to create one or more default todos from the tests.

```

it('should append new items to the bottom of the list', function () {
  cy.createDefaultTodos().as('todos')
  // more test commands
})

```
